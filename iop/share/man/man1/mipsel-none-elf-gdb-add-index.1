.SH NAME
gdb\-add\-index \- Add index files to speed up GDB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
gdb-add-index \fIfilename\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When GDB finds a symbol file, it scans the symbols in the
file in order to construct an internal symbol table.  This lets most
GDB operations work quickly\-\-at the cost of a delay early on.
For large programs, this delay can be quite lengthy, so GDB
provides a way to build an index, which speeds up startup.
.PP
To determine whether a file contains such an index, use the command
\&\f(CW\*(C`readelf \-S filename\*(C'\fR: the index is stored in a section named
\&\f(CW\*(C`.gdb_index\*(C'\fR.  The index file can only be produced on systems
which use ELF binaries and DWARF debug information (i.e., sections
named \f(CW\*(C`.debug_*\*(C'\fR).
.PP
\&\fBgdb-add-index\fR uses GDB and \fBobjdump\fR found
in the \fBPATH\fR environment variable.  If you want to use different
versions of these programs, you can specify them through the
\&\fBGDB\fR and \fBOBJDUMP\fR environment variables.
.PP
See more in
the GDB manual in node \f(CW\*(C`Index Files\*(C'\fR
\&\-\- shell command \f(CW\*(C`info \-f gdb \-n "Index Files"\*(C'\fR.

The full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
If the \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR programs and GDB's Texinfo
documentation are properly installed at your site, the command
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        info gdb
.Ve
.PP
should give you access to the complete manual.
